// a=2 b=5
// pow(a, b) calculates 2^5, which is equal to 32.

// b * log(a) calculates 5 * log(2), which is approximately equal to 5 * 0.6931 â‰ˆ 3.4655.
// pow(a, b) and b*log(a) is same?
// No, pow(a, b) and b * log(a) are not the same. They represent different mathematical operations and can yield different results.

// pow(a, b) calculates "a raised to the power of b." It means that it calculates a^b, where 'a' is the base, and 'b' is the exponent.

// b * log(a) calculates "b multiplied by the natural logarithm of a." It means that it calculates b * ln(a), where 'a' is the number whose natural logarithm is taken, and 'b' is multiplied by that result.

// These two expressions will generally yield different results for non-integer values of 'b' and 'a'. However, for integer values of 'b' and 'a,' they will produce the same result. The relationship between them is based on the properties of 
// logarithms and exponentiation, particularly when dealing with integer exponents.
